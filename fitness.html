      <h3>4. Mix Up Your Workouts</h3>
      <p>Vary your workout routine to keep things interesting and prevent boredom. Incorporate a mix of cardio exercises, strength training, flexibility exercises, and other activities to work different muscle groups and challenge your body.</p>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>5. Listen to Your Body</h3>
      <p>Pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise. Respect your limits and avoid pushing yourself too hard, which can lead to injuries. Rest when needed, and don't hesitate to seek professional guidance when necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>6. Stay Hydrated</h3>
      <p>Proper hydration is essential for optimal performance and recovery. Drink water before, during, and after your workouts to maintain hydration levels. Avoid sugary drinks and opt for water as your primary source of hydration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>7. Get Sufficient Rest and Recovery</h3>
      <p>Allow your body time to rest and recover between workouts. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night to support muscle repair and overall well-being. Incorporate active recovery days or gentle stretching sessions into your routine to aid in muscle recovery.</p>
